# Introduction

This notebook forms our analysis which will be `knitr`-ed into a `pdf` and then uploaded to  `osf.io`.  It comprises three three sections: 

1. *Data loading*: loading the data into workbook and inspecting its contents
2. *Tidy data*: doing some simple manipulation with `dplyr` to  make the data frame *tidy*. Save the tidied dataframe. 
4. *Analysis*: do a simple logistic regression.  


# Data loading

Load the data using `read.csv()` into a data frame called `df_raw`:

```{r}
df_raw <- read.csv('../data/original/dili_from_anti_TB_treatment.csv')
```

Check the dimensions using `dim` to make sure we've captured all the variables and observations. 

```{r}
dim(df_raw)
```

Use the `str` command to check how the variables have been read in: 

```{r}
str(df_raw)
```

How use the `head` command to inspect the first few rows for a further check. 

```{r}
head(df_raw)
```

## Tidy data

We can use `mutate` with the function `factor` to create a new categorical variable called `dili`.  If we add add `pdili` to `t1dili` we get a unique set of *levels* (0,1,2) and we can *label* these how we choose.  
  
| `pdili`  | `t1dili` | `pdili` + `t1dili` (levels) |`dili` (labels)  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0  |  0  |  0 |'C' |
| 1  |  1 | 2   |'T1' |
| 1  |  0 | 1   |'T23'|

First make the categorical variable and save the new dataframe as `df_tidy`. Make sure you get the ordering of the labels correct! You'll also need to import `tidyverse`. 

```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
df_tidy <- df_raw %>%
  mutate(dili=factor(pdili+t1dili, labels=c('C', 'T23', 'T1')))
```

Now use `str` it was created correctly. 

```{r}
str(df_tidy)
```

Use `head` on a subset of the columns to make sure the calculation was performed correctly: 

```{r}
head(df_tidy[,c('pdili', 't1dili', 'dili')])
```

Now delete the columns: `pdili`, `t1dili`, `time_to_onset_of_pDILI`, `liver_disease`, and `tb_site` by using `mutate` to set these to `NULL`. Use `str` to check again. 

```{r}
df_tidy <- df_tidy %>%
  mutate(pdili=NULL, t1dili=NULL, time_to_onset_of_pDILI=NULL, tb_site=NULL, liver_disease=NULL)
str(df_tidy)
```

Now save the dataframe as `../data/processed/df_tidy.Rda`:

```{r}
save(df_tidy, file='../data/processed/df_tidy.Rda')
```

# Analysis

![](fig/Table 3.png)

Here's we're just going to calculate odds ratios (crude and adjusted) for the first risk factor, `log10base_alt`.  I'll give you the code for the crude odds ratios, then you can fill out the details for the adjusted odds ratio. 

```{r}
crudeOR <- glm('dili ~ log10base_alt', family=binomial(link='logit'), data=filter(df_tidy, dili=='T1' | dili=='C')) 
```

Check the summary:

```{r}
summary(crudeOR)
```

Put the coefficients and standard errors into a dataframe for easy manipulation.
```{r}
crudeORdf <- as.data.frame(summary(crudeOR)$coefficient)
head(crudeORdf)
```

Here we're doing three things: 
1. Clean up the column names using `janitor` (you'll need to install this). 
2. Change the row names to columns (otherwise they'll get lost). 
3. Use `rename` (from `dplyr`) to change `estimate` to `beta` for clarity 

```{r}
library(janitor)
crudeORdf <- crudeORdf %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var='riskfactor') %>%
  rename(beta=estimate)
head(crudeORdf)
```

Now lets use the standard errors to get 95% confidence intervals:

```{r}
crudeORdf <- crudeORdf %>%
  mutate(beta_low = beta - 1.96*std_error, beta_high = beta + 1.96*std_error)
head(crudeORdf)
```

Now we can exponentiate the betas:

```{r}
crudeORdf %>%
  # Exponentiates only those columns starting with 'beta'.  
  # Appends 'OR' to the end. 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("beta")),funs(OR = exp)) %>%
  # Just select the columns with odds ratios and the risk factor name
  select(riskfactor, ends_with('OR', ignore.case = FALSE))

```

To do the adjusted odds ratios, repeat as above, but the formula now includes `agegroup`, `sex`, `log10base_alp` and `log10base_bili` (e.g. 'dili ~ log10base_alt + agegroup...')
